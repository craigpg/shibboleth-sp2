shibboleth-sp2 (2.3.1+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify shib-keygen to create the new certificate key group-readable by
    _shibd and not world-readable.  (Closes: #571631)
  * Force source format 1.0 for now since it makes backporting easier.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V7.
    - Use dh_prep instead of dh_clean -k.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

shibboleth-sp2 (2.3.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Don't sign messages for SOAP requests twice.
    - Correctly generate metadata in the artifact resolution handler.
    - Artifact resolution should return empty success on errors.
    - Fixed crash in backchannel global logout.
    - Fix duplicate indexes in metadata generation when multiple base URLs
      are supplied.
    - Correctly decrypt assertions in attribute responses.
  * Apply upstream fix for shibd removing the PID file when called with
    the -F option.  This prevents the check of certificate permissions in
    the init script from removing the PID file of a running shibd.
  * Add ${shlibs:Depends} to the libshibsp-dev package dependencies.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all package dependencies.

shibboleth-sp2 (2.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Urgency set to high for security fix.
  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY: Partial fix for improper handling of URLs that could be
      abused for script injection and other cross-site scripting attacks.
      The complete fix also requires newer xmltooling and opensaml2
      packages.  (Closes: #555608, CVE-2009-3300)
    - Avoid shibd crash on dead memcache server.
    - Pass the affiliation name to the session initiator.
    - Correctly handle a bogus ACS.
    - Allow overriding the URL that's passed to the DS.
    - Add schema types for new attribute decoders introduced in 2.2.
    - Handle success with partial logout in the logout UI code.
    - Fix POST data preservation with empty parameters and empty forms.
    - Fix SAML 1 specification of attributes in the query plugin.
    - Shorten ePTId-type persistent identifiers.
    - Use an ID rather than a whole doc reference for generated metadata.
    - Fix spelling of scopeDelimiter in the configuration parser, making
      the code and documentation match the schema.
  * Rename library package for upstream SONAME bump.
  * Tighten build and package dependencies on xmltooling and opensaml2 to
    require the versions with the security fix.
  * Fix watch file for the new version mangling.
  * Improve documentation of DAEMON_OPTS in /etc/default/shibd.
  * Remove unnecessary patches to upstream files regenerated during the
    build from the source package diff.

  [ Faidon Liambotis ]
  * Run make install with NOKEYGEN=1 and stop rm-ing generated
    certificates.  Fixes FTBFS.

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Run shibd as non-root.

  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY: Fix improper handling of certificate names containing nul

shibboleth-sp2 (2.1.dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Redo the variable quoting in doxygen.m4 so that configure can be
    rebuilt with Autoconf 2.63.  (Closes: #518039)

shibboleth-sp2 (2.1.dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream version.
    - New memory cache storage backend.
    - Schema validation is now optional.
    - Many bug fixes.
  * Bump SONAME of libshibsp following upstream's versioning.
  * Build-depend on libsaml2-dev >= 2.1 following the upstream spec file
    and libxmltooling-dev 1.1 just in case (required by OpenSAML 2.1).
  * Fix the name of the tarball created by get-orig-source.
  * Logcheck rules.
  * Tighten the dependency versioning; the 2.1 SP library requires the
    2.1 schemas from the Shibboleth SP and OpenSAML and the 1.1 schemas
    from XMLTooling.
  * Remove duplicate Section field for libapache2-mod-shib2.

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Follow the libshibsp1->2 package rename in the dh_makeshlibs invocation.
  * Remove the Shibboleth minor version number from README.Debian.
  * Comment out the reference to WS-Trust.xsd from the catalog.xml file in
    shibboleth-sp2-schemas and document how to enable it again.

shibboleth-sp2 (2.0.dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Rename debian/shib.load to debian/shib2.load to avoid clashing with the
    libapache2-mod-shib package.  Otherwise its Apache config file breaks our
    module.
  * Add directory /var/log/shibboleth to libapache2-mod-shib2 (thanks to Peter
    Schober for noticing)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add a postinst to disable the old configuration on upgrade and enable
    the module if it had been enabled under the old configuration name.
  * Wait for shibd to exit on stop or restart.  This fixes a bug in
    restart that could lead to no new shibd being started because the old
    one had not yet exited.
  * Fix a syntax error in the shibd man page.

    (Closes: #493408)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add logcheck rules to ignore some of the routine messages from the
    Apache module.  This only covers startup and teardown; more will
    need to be added.
  * Fix watch file for new upstream tarball naming.
